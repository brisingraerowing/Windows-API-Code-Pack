Usage notes
-----------

This assembly/package mainly contains P/Invoke methods but, for a few methods, Windows API Code Pack-native methods are also provided for better compatibility with the Windows methods. Also notice that P/Invoke methods that take COM parameters are now included in the WinCopies.WindowsAPICodePack.COMNative package.
